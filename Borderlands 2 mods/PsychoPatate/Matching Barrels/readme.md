### Matching Barrels V.1.1 (23/08/18) by PsychoPatate
---

#### Intro
Simple mod to make unique weapons have the barrel from their manufacturer.  
(Sand Hawk has a Dahl barrel, Pimpernel has a Maliwan barrel, etc...)

#### What does it do ?
- Changes the barrel of (almost) all unique weapons to match their manufacturer.
- Some weapons are left unchanged, see details below.
- **THIS MOD ONLY CHANGES THE APPEARANCE OF WEAPONS, NO ACTUAL STATS ARE AFFECTED.**

#### Unchanged weapons :
- It doesn't change weapons that has an E-Tech barrel.
- It doesn't change assault rifles that has a minigun barrel
- It doesn't change assault rifles that has a grenade/rocket launcher barrel
- It doesn't change most shotgun barrels, because it's stupid to put a triple barrel on a shotgun that uses 2 ammo per shot (only the **Butcher** and **Shotgun 1340** changed)
